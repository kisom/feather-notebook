Notes
=====

- Soldering boards in the bottom position (e.g. female headers) really
  limits the usefulness of the board. If possible, reserve this for
  compute modules.
- Avoid soldering in the top position, except maybe the display modules.
- You can never have too many extra stacking headers.
- You can never have too many extra adaloggers.
